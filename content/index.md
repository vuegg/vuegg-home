Scaffold vuejs projects by dragging-dropping components directly into the visual editor and moving-resizing them to your choice. Vuegg leverages the creation of the pages and routes of your app/website, eases the styling work and helps to achieve a rapid-prototyping workflow (... at least in theory).

The aim of this project is to merge designing and prototyping into one single process. Whenever you're happy with what you see on the screen, just get your code.
